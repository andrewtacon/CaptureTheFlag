# CaptureTheFlag
Capture the Flag - A javascript version of https://github.com/tuxta/GF_Capture_The_Flag

The game needs to be run from a server. It dynamically loads the AI files that are to compete against each other and merges them into the code as the page is generated.

To create your own AI, look at the ai.js template file for instructions.

The dummyAI currently does nothing.

Needs a bit of a paint job in parts

Built using p5.js
